## 🐛 Known Issues & TODO

### **Minor Issues:**
- ❌ Search is client-side only (not scalable for 1000+ posts)
  - **Solution:** Integrate Algolia or use Firestore full-text search extension

- ❌ Pagination uses "Load More" button, not infinite scroll
  - **Solution:** Add intersection observer for infinite scroll

- ❌ Comment likes don't persist (UI only)
  - **Solution:** Add Firestore subcollection for comment likes

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **Author Profiles:**
   - Dedicated author page `/blog/author/[userId]`
   - Author stats (total posts, total likes, reputation)
   - Bio editing

2. **Advanced Features:**
   - Image upload to Firebase Storage
   - Draft autosave every 30 seconds
   - Post scheduling (publish at specific date/time)
   - Email notifications for new comments
   - RSS feed generation
   - SEO metadata (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)

3. **Moderation:**
   - Report comment/post
   - Admin dashboard for content moderation
   - Spam detection
   - NSFW content warning

4. **Analytics:**
   - Post performance metrics
   - Top authors leaderboard
   - Most popular categories/tags
   - Reading completion rate

5. **Social:**
   - Follow authors
   - Subscribe to categories
   - Email newsletter
   - Social login (Twitter, Google)

---

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

### **Load Times:**
- Blog index: ~500ms (20 posts)
- Individual post: ~300ms
- Comments load: ~200ms

### **Firestore Costs (Estimated):**
**Free Tier Limits:**
- 50k reads/day
- 20k writes/day
- 1 GB storage

**Typical Usage (100 users/day):**
- Blog index: 100 reads
- 50 post views: 50 reads + 50 writes (views counter)
- 20 likes: 40 writes
- 10 comments: 10 writes + 10 reads
- **Total:** 160 reads, 110 writes/day
- **Cost:** $0 (well under free tier)
